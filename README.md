Abstract. The article presents a concept for developing a web platform for learning business Chinese using artificial intelligence technologies and interactive video content. It considers the prerequisites for creating a digital educational solution focused on developing practical business communication skills in an international trade environment in relations with China. The architecture of the platform, including the client and server parts, as well as the natural language processing module, is described in detail. The principles of user interface design aimed at ensuring convenience and intuitive interaction are highlighted. The results of testing functional and non-functional requirements are presented. Attention is paid to the integration of an AI chatbot as a tool for modeling real negotiation scenarios and automated feedback. it's my email for connection bakhitbekovv@gmail.com

## 🌱 Personal Motivation
Language learning has historically been rigid and static. As someone deeply invested in cross-cultural communication—and actively studying Chinese at an advanced level (HSK 4)—I wanted to build a tool that I would actually use. This project stems from my passion for the intersection of EdTech and Natural Language Processing. Beyond Chinese, building this conversational AI architecture serves as a foundational step toward my broader goal: applying advanced NLP to support and preserve low-resource languages, and eventually scaling these technologies into new linguistic frontiers like Arabic.

## 🎯 Research Objectives
- Develop an intelligent architectural framework integrating client-server structures with an advanced NLP module.
- Overcome the limitations of static language learning by deploying context-rich, simulation-based conversational AI.
- Design an intuitive user interface that reduces cognitive load while providing automated, real-time feedback on user pronunciation, grammar, and negotiation tactics.

## 🧠 Methodology & Tech Stack
- **Conversational AI:** Integration of LLMs customized for business Chinese contexts and dialogue trees.
- **Assessment Module:** Automated feedback loops for grammar correction and sentiment analysis of the user's negotiation stance.
- **Web Architecture:** Next.js (React) frontend with a Node.js/Express backend.

## 📊 Key Findings / Results
- Successfully modeled real-world business negotiation scenarios (e.g., price haggling, contract terms) using the integrated AI chatbot.
- Demonstrated high user engagement and retention in pre-alpha testing compared to traditional static reading/listening exercises.

## 📬 Full Paper Request & Contact
As the full paper containing the detailed system architecture and performance metrics is actively being published across multiple academic publishers and media outlets, the complete manuscript is not fully published in this public repository yet. 

I am highly open to academic collaboration and would gladly share the full manuscript drafts with interested professors and researchers. 

**Research Interests:** My core trajectory is focused on foundational model development and cross-cultural NLP. My ultimate academic goal is to research at **MBZUAI**, contributing to the **Jais** ecosystem and advancing MENA-region AI.
